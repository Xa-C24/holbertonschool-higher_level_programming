**Python - Exceptions**  

Exceptions in Python are errors that occur during program execution.  
Python offers mechanisms for handling these errors in an elegant way, so that the program doesn't abruptly terminate in the event of a problem.  
Exception handling makes it possible to anticipate and control program flow even when an error occurs.  

1. What is an exception?  

An exception is an unexpected condition that interrupts the normal execution of a program.  
In Python, exceptions are raised automatically when an error occurs, or manually using the raise command.  


2. Basic exception handling syntax  

Python uses try, except, else and finally blocks to handle exceptions.
