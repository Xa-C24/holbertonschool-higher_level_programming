**Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples**  

**1. Lists in Python What is a list?**   
A list is an ordered, editable collection in Python.  
It can contain elements of various types (integers, strings, objects, etc.).  
Lists are defined by square brackets [].  

		ma_liste = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  

  
**2. Tuples in Python What is a tuple?**  A tuple is an ordered but immutable collection.  
Unlike lists, once created, a tuple cannot be modified.  
Tuples are defined by parentheses (). 
		
		mon_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  


 Use cases:  
  - List: Use a list when you need to modify your data (add, delete or change items).  
  - Tuple: Use a tuple when data must remain constant and you need better performance for read operations.  

In conclusion, lists are perfect when you need flexibility to manipulate your data,  
while tuples offer improved performance and are ideal for storing constant, unmodifiable data.
